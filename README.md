# Akan Name Generator

## Project Overview
The **Akan Name Generator** is a web application designed to determine the day of the week a user was born and assign them a traditional Akan name based on Ghanaian culture. In Ghana, names are given according to the day of birth, with distinct names for males and females. This project combines cultural significance with programming concepts such as **arrays, functions, control flow, and user input validation**.

## Features
- **Date Validation:** Ensures the entered date is correct.
- **Gender Selection:** Users must select their gender before generating the name.
- **Day Calculation:** Uses a formula to determine the day of the week.
- **Akan Name Assignment:** Matches the birthdate to the appropriate Akan name.
- **Interactive UI:** Simple, clean, and responsive design.
- **GitHub Pages Deployment:** Accessible online for users.
